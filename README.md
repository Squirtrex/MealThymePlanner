# MealThymePlanner
Meal Planning app
CS-321-002: Group 8

Our app is a recipe and meal prep app designed to intelligently recommend personalized meals for you to make at home based on many different preferences. The intelligent algorithm will take into account preferences such as what kind of cuisines you like, food  allergies and dietary restrictions, and other recipes you have liked. The app also has other helpful features such as planning future meals to eat and searching for specific recipes. 

To run the simulator, open the project in the IntelliJ IDE and download the CodeNameOne plugin, make sure that the JDK is JDK 16 and up, make sure to run the program "in device simulator", and not just the files.
